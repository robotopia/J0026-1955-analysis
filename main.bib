abstract = {Studying the gravitational-wave sky with pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) is a key science goal for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and its pathfinder telescopes. With current PTAs reaching sub-microsecond timing precision, making accurate measurements of interstellar propagation effects and mitigating them effectively has become increasingly important to realise PTA goals. As these effects are much stronger at longer wavelengths, low-frequency observations are most appealing for characterizing the interstellar medium (ISM) along the sight lines toward PTA pulsars. The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and the Engineering Development Array (EDA), which utilizes MWA technologies, present promising opportunities for undertaking such studies, particularly for PTA pulsars located in the southern sky. Such pulsars are also the prime targets for PTA efforts planned with the South African MeerKAT, and eventually with the SKA. In this paper we report on observations of two bright southern millisecond pulsars PSRs J0437-4715 and J2145-0750 made with these facilities; MWA observations sampling multiple frequencies across the 80-250 MHz frequency range, while the EDA providing direct-sampled baseband data to yield a large instantaneous usable bandwidth of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}200 MHz. Using these observations, we investigate various aspects relating to pulsar emission and ISM properties, such as spectral evolution of the mean pulse shape, scintillation as a function of frequency, chromaticity in interstellar dispersion, and flux density spectra at low frequencies. Systematic and regular monitoring observations will help ascertain the role of low-frequency measurements in PTA experiments, while simultaneously providing a detailed characterization of the ISM toward the pulsars, which will be useful in devising optimal observing strategies for future PTA experiments.},

abstract = {The beautiful sequences of drifting subpulses observed in some radio pulsars have been regarded as among the most salient and potentially instructive characteristics of their emission, not least because they have appeared to represent a system of subbeams in motion within the emission zone of the star. Numerous studies of these drift sequences have been published, and a model of their generation and motion was articulated long ago by Ruderman {\&} Sutherland; but thus far, efforts have failed to establish an illuminating connection between the drift phenomenon and the actual sites of radio emission. Through a detailed analysis of a nearly coherent sequence of drifting pulses from the pulsar B0943+10, we have in fact identified a system of subbeams circulating around the magnetic axis of the star. A mapping technique, involving a cartographic transform and its inverse, permits us to study the character of the polar cap emission map and then to confirm that it, in turn, represents the observed pulse sequence. On this basis, we have been able to trace the physical origin of the drifting subpulse emission to a stably rotating and remarkably organized configuration of emission columns, in turn traceable possibly to the magnetic polar cap gap region envisioned by some theories.},

abstract = {An investigation of nulling and subpulse drifting in the two pulsars PSRs 0809+74 and 0818-13 is presented from data recorded at 408 MHz. Upper limits are placed, in the case of PSR 0809+74, on the time constants of the decay and rise of pulse energy at nulls of 0.065 and 0.26 s respectively. Significant drifting is found to occur during nulls in this pulsar. Its behavior is best described by a sudden change of drift rate at the start of the null, followed by an exponential relaxation to the normal drift rate, with emission restarting when a fixed fraction of the recovery has taken place. A similar phenomenon is observed for PSR 0818-13. For both pulsars the magnitude of these events appears to be proportional to the null strength. These observations are taken as evidence that the entity that is drifting survives in some form during nulls. An attempt is made to interpret this in terms of current models.},

Here, we report on new observations of PSR J0034‑0721 (B0031‑07) carried out with the Murchison Widefield Array at 185 {\{}MHz{\}}. We observe three distinct drift modes whose “vertical” drift band separations (P3) and relative abundances are consistent with previous studies at similar and higher frequencies. The drift bands, however, are observed to change their slopes over the course of individual drift modes, which can be interpreted as a continuously changing drift rate. The implied acceleration of the intrinsic carousel rotation cannot easily be explained by plasma models based on E×B drift. Furthermore, we find that methods of classifying the drift modes by means of P3 measurements can sometimes produce erroneous identifications in the presence of a changing drift rate. The “horizontal” separation between drift bands (P2) is found to be larger at later rotation phases within the pulse window, which is inconsistent with the established effects of retardation, aberration, and the motion of the visible point. Longer observations spanning at least ∼10,000 pulses are required to determine how the carousel rotation parameters change from one drift sequence to the next.},

abstract = {The carousel model of pulsar emission attributes the phenomenon of subpulse drifting to a set of discrete sparks located very near the stellar surface rotating around the magnetic axis. Here, we investigate the subpulse drifting behavior of PSR B0031−07 in the context of the carousel model. We show that B0031−07's three drift modes (A, B, and C) can be understood in terms of a single carousel rotation rate if the number of sparks is allowed to change by an integral number, and where the different drift rates are due to (first-order) aliasing effects. This also results in harmonically related values for P 3 (the time it takes a subpulse to reappear at the same pulse phase), which we confirm for B0031−07. A representative solution has [n A, n B, n C] = [15, 14, 13] sparks and a carousel rotation period of P 4 = 16.4 P 1. We also investigate the frequency dependence of B0031−07's subpulse behavior. We extend the carousel model to include the dual effects of aberration and retardation, including the time it takes the information about the surface spark configuration to travel from the surface up to the emission point. Assuming these effects dominate at B0031−07's emission heights, we derive conservative emission height differences of ≲2000 km for mode A and ≲1000 km for modes B and C as seen between 185 and 610 MHz. This new method of measuring emission heights is independent of others that involve average profile components or the polarization position angle curve, and thus provides a potentially strong test of the carousel model.},

Profile mode changing is studied as a reorganization of core and conal emission, and it is shown that modal changes of the average profile prototypically occur in pulsars having triple or multiple profiles. It is demonstrated that drifting subpulses are associated with conal emission, and that stars which prototypically exhibit the drifting subpulse phenomenon all have conal single profiles wherein the sight line traverses the conal emission lobe tangentially. Finally, it is shown that, within a given profile class, stars which null are no older than those which do not, and the null fraction does not seem to increase with age. Pulsars thus do not null simply by virtue of their age.},

abstract = {Arecibo observations of the conal triple pulsar B1918+19 at 0.327- and 1.4-GHz are used to analyse its subpulse behaviour in detail. We confirm the presence of three distinct drift modes (A,B,C) plus a disordered mode (N) and show that they follow one another in specific cycles. Interpreting the pulsar's profile as resulting from a sightline traverse which cuts across an outer cone and tangentially grazes an inner cone, we demonstrate that the phase modulation of the inner cone is locked to the amplitude modulation of the outer cone in all the drift modes. The 9{\%} nulls are found to be largely confined to the dominant B and N modes, and, in the N mode, create alternating bunches of nulls and emission in a quasi-periodic manner with an averaged fluctuation rate of about 12 rotation periods ({\$}P{\_}1{\$}). We explore the assumption that the apparent drift is the first alias of a faster drift of subbeams equally spaced around the cones. This is shown to imply that all modes A, B and C have a common circulation time of 12 {\$}P{\_}1{\$} and differ only in the number of subbeams. This timescale is on the same order as predicted by the classic {\{}$\backslash$bf E{\}}{\$}\backslashtimes{\$}{\{}$\backslash$bf B{\}} drift and also coincides with the N-mode modulation. We therefore arrive at a picture where the circulation speed remains roughly invariant while the subbeams progressively diminish in number from modes A to B to C, and are then re-established during the N mode. We suggest that aliasing combined with subbeam loss may be responsible for apparently dramatic changes in drift rates in other pulsars.},

A polar magnetospheric gap is formed that spans the open field lines from the stellar surface up to an altitude of about 10,000 cm. The scalar product of the electric and magnetic fields is nonzero in the gap, although it vanishes essentially everywhere else in the near magnetosphere. The potential difference between the base and the top of the gap is about 1 trillion volts. The gap continually breaks down by forming electron-positron pairs on a time scale of a few microseconds. The gap positrons move out along the open field lines and electrons flow to the stellar surface to close the pulsar's homopolar generator circuit. The proposed model can explain many characteristics of the coherent microwave radiation observed from pulsars.},

@article{Tremblay2015,
abstract = {The science cases for incorporating high time resolution capabilities into modern radio telescopes are as numerous as they are compelling. Science targets range from exotic sources such as pulsars, to our Sun, to recently detected possible extragalactic bursts of radio emission, the so-called fast radio bursts (FRBs). Originally conceived purely as an imaging telescope, the initial design of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) did not include the ability to access high time and frequency resolution voltage data. However, the flexibility of the MWA's software correlator allowed an off-the-shelf solution for adding this capability. This paper describes the system that records the 100 mus and 10 kHz resolution voltage data from the MWA. Example science applications, where this capability is critical, are presented, as well as accompanying commissioning results from this mode to demonstrate verification.},

abstract = {Both nulling and subpulse drifting are poorly understood phenomena. We  probe their mechanisms by investigating how they interact in PSR  B0809+74. We find that the subpulse drift is not aliased but directly  reflects the actual motion of the subbeams. The carousel-rotation time  must then be over 200 s, which is much longer than theoretically  predicted.},
