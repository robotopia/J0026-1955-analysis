abstract = {Studying the gravitational-wave sky with pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) is a key science goal for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and its pathfinder telescopes. With current PTAs reaching sub-microsecond timing precision, making accurate measurements of interstellar propagation effects and mitigating them effectively has become increasingly important to realise PTA goals. As these effects are much stronger at longer wavelengths, low-frequency observations are most appealing for characterizing the interstellar medium (ISM) along the sight lines toward PTA pulsars. The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and the Engineering Development Array (EDA), which utilizes MWA technologies, present promising opportunities for undertaking such studies, particularly for PTA pulsars located in the southern sky. Such pulsars are also the prime targets for PTA efforts planned with the South African MeerKAT, and eventually with the SKA. In this paper we report on observations of two bright southern millisecond pulsars PSRs J0437-4715 and J2145-0750 made with these facilities; MWA observations sampling multiple frequencies across the 80-250 MHz frequency range, while the EDA providing direct-sampled baseband data to yield a large instantaneous usable bandwidth of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}200 MHz. Using these observations, we investigate various aspects relating to pulsar emission and ISM properties, such as spectral evolution of the mean pulse shape, scintillation as a function of frequency, chromaticity in interstellar dispersion, and flux density spectra at low frequencies. Systematic and regular monitoring observations will help ascertain the role of low-frequency measurements in PTA experiments, while simultaneously providing a detailed characterization of the ISM toward the pulsars, which will be useful in devising optimal observing strategies for future PTA experiments.},

abstract = {The beautiful sequences of drifting subpulses observed in some radio pulsars have been regarded as among the most salient and potentially instructive characteristics of their emission, not least because they have appeared to represent a system of subbeams in motion within the emission zone of the star. Numerous studies of these drift sequences have been published, and a model of their generation and motion was articulated long ago by Ruderman {\&} Sutherland; but thus far, efforts have failed to establish an illuminating connection between the drift phenomenon and the actual sites of radio emission. Through a detailed analysis of a nearly coherent sequence of drifting pulses from the pulsar B0943+10, we have in fact identified a system of subbeams circulating around the magnetic axis of the star. A mapping technique, involving a cartographic transform and its inverse, permits us to study the character of the polar cap emission map and then to confirm that it, in turn, represents the observed pulse sequence. On this basis, we have been able to trace the physical origin of the drifting subpulse emission to a stably rotating and remarkably organized configuration of emission columns, in turn traceable possibly to the magnetic polar cap gap region envisioned by some theories.},

abstract = {The ``drifting'' subpulses exhibited by some radio pulsars have fascinated both observers and theorists for 30 years, and have been widely regarded as one of the most critical and potentially insightful aspects of their emission. Here, we report on detailed studies of pulsar B0943+10, whose nearly coherent sequences of ``drifting'' subpulses have permitted us to identify their origin as a system of subbeams that appear to circulate around the star's magnetic axis. We introduce several new techniques of analysis, and we find that both the primary and secondary features in the star's fluctuation spectra are aliases of their actual values. We have also developed a method of tracing the underlying pattern responsible for the observed sequences, using a ``cartographic'' transform and its inverse, permitting us to study the characteristics of the polar-cap emission ``map'' and to confirm that such a ``map'' in turn represents the observed sequence. We apply these techniques to the study of three different Arecibo observations. The ``B''-mode sequences are consistent in revealing that the emission pattern consists of 20 subbeams, which rotate around the magnetic axis in about 37 periods or 41 seconds. Even in the ``Q'' mode sequence, we find evidence of a compatible circulation time. The similarity of the subbeam patterns at different radio frequencies strongly suggests that the radiation is produced within a set of columns, which extend from close to the stellar surface up though the emission region and reflect some manner of a ``seeding''phenomenon at their base. The subbeam emission is then tied neither to the stellar surface nor to the field.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT  We present high-quality observations of PSR B0826-34 at 1374 MHz. The emission from this pulsar exhibits strong bursts of pulses followed by long periods of 'null' pulses. When it is strong, the radiation extends throughout the whole pulse period. We show for the first time that there is weak emission during the 'null' phases, which should therefore be considered to be a different mode rather than being null. During this weak mode, the profile is similar to that observed in the strong mode at low radio frequency. Using a phase-tracking method, the pattern of drifting subpulses during the strong mode is seen to be coherent across the whole profile. The drift rate is variable and includes positive and negative values. 13 subpulse bands have been directly observed, covering the whole longitude range. The subpulses and their spacings (P2) are wider in one half of the profile than those in the other half. This difference, and the variation of observed P2 within the two regions, can be accounted for if the magnetic pole is inclined to the rotation axis by about 05. These two regions appear to represent radiation from outer and inner cones. The intensity modulation of subpulses in all longitude ranges is related to the magnitude of the drift rate.},

Known collectively as the PSRCHIVE scheme, the code was developed in parallel with a new data storage format called PSRFITS, which is based on the Flexible Image Transport System (FITS). Both of these projects utilise a modular, object-oriented design philosophy. PSRCHIVE is an open source development environment that incorporates an extensive range of C++ object classes and pre-built command line and graphical utilities. These deal transparently and simultaneously with multiple data storage formats, thereby enhancing data portability and facilitating the adoption of the PSRFITS file format. Here, data are stored in a series of modular header-data units that provide flexibility and scope for future expansion. As it is based on FITS, various standard libraries and applications may be used for data input/output and visualisation. Both PSRCHIVE and PSRFITS are made publicly available to the academic community in the hope that this will promote their widespread use and acceptance.},

Significant drifting is found to occur during nulls in this pulsar. Its behavior is best described by a sudden change of drift rate at the start of the null, followed by an exponential relaxation to the normal drift rate, with emission restarting when a fixed fraction of the recovery has taken place. A similar phenomenon is observed for PSR 0818-13. For both pulsars the magnitude of these events appears to be proportional to the null strength. These observations are taken as evidence that the entity that is drifting survives in some form during nulls. An attempt is made to interpret this in terms of current models.},

Here, we report on new observations of PSR J0034‑0721 (B0031‑07) carried out with the Murchison Widefield Array at 185 {\{}MHz{\}}. We observe three distinct drift modes whose “vertical” drift band separations (P3) and relative abundances are consistent with previous studies at similar and higher frequencies. The drift bands, however, are observed to change their slopes over the course of individual drift modes, which can be interpreted as a continuously changing drift rate. The implied acceleration of the intrinsic carousel rotation cannot easily be explained by plasma models based on E×B drift. Furthermore, we find that methods of classifying the drift modes by means of P3 measurements can sometimes produce erroneous identifications in the presence of a changing drift rate. The “horizontal” separation between drift bands (P2) is found to be larger at later rotation phases within the pulse window, which is inconsistent with the established effects of retardation, aberration, and the motion of the visible point. Longer observations spanning at least ∼10,000 pulses are required to determine how the carousel rotation parameters change from one drift sequence to the next.},

abstract = {The carousel model of pulsar emission attributes the phenomenon of subpulse drifting to a set of discrete sparks located very near the stellar surface rotating around the magnetic axis. Here, we investigate the subpulse drifting behavior of PSR B0031−07 in the context of the carousel model. We show that B0031−07's three drift modes (A, B, and C) can be understood in terms of a single carousel rotation rate if the number of sparks is allowed to change by an integral number, and where the different drift rates are due to (first-order) aliasing effects. This also results in harmonically related values for P 3 (the time it takes a subpulse to reappear at the same pulse phase), which we confirm for B0031−07. A representative solution has [n A, n B, n C] = [15, 14, 13] sparks and a carousel rotation period of P 4 = 16.4 P 1. We also investigate the frequency dependence of B0031−07's subpulse behavior. We extend the carousel model to include the dual effects of aberration and retardation, including the time it takes the information about the surface spark configuration to travel from the surface up to the emission point. Assuming these effects dominate at B0031−07's emission heights, we derive conservative emission height differences of ≲2000 km for mode A and ≲1000 km for modes B and C as seen between 185 and 610 MHz. This new method of measuring emission heights is independent of others that involve average profile components or the polarization position angle curve, and thus provides a potentially strong test of the carousel model.},

abstract = {A new high time resolution observing mode for the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is described, enabling full polarimetric observations with up to {\$}30.72\backslash,{\$} MHz of bandwidth and a time resolution of {\$}{\{}\backslashsim{\}}{\$} {\$}0.8\backslash,\backslashupmu{\$} s. This mode makes use of a polyphase synthesis filter to ‘undo' the polyphase analysis filter stage of the standard MWA's Voltage Capture System observing mode. Sources of potential error in the reconstruction of the high time resolution data are identified and quantified, with the {\$}S/N{\$} loss induced by the back-to-back system not exceeding {\$}-0.65\backslash,{\$} dB for typical noise-dominated samples. The system is further verified by observing three pulsars with known structure on microsecond timescales.},

The MWA operates at low radio frequencies, 80-300 MHz, with a processed bandwidth of 30.72 MHz for both linear polarisations, and consists of 128 aperture arrays (known as tiles) distributed over a {\~{}}3-km diameter area. Novel hybrid hardware/software correlation and a real-time imaging and calibration systems comprise the MWA signal processing backend. In this paper, the as-built MWA is described both at a system and sub-system level, the expected performance of the array is presented, and the science goals of the instrument are summarised.},

abstract = {The science cases for incorporating high time resolution capabilities into modern radio telescopes are as numerous as they are compelling. Science targets range from exotic sources such as pulsars, to our Sun, to recently detected possible extragalactic bursts of radio emission, the so-called fast radio bursts (FRBs). Originally conceived purely as an imaging telescope, the initial design of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) did not include the ability to access high time and frequency resolution voltage data. However, the flexibility of the MWA's software correlator allowed an off-the-shelf solution for adding this capability. This paper describes the system that records the 100 mus and 10 kHz resolution voltage data from the MWA. Example science applications, where this capability is critical, are presented, as well as accompanying commissioning results from this mode to demonstrate verification.},
