@article{Bhat2018,
abstract = {Studying the gravitational-wave sky with pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) is a key science goal for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and its pathfinder telescopes. With current PTAs reaching sub-microsecond timing precision, making accurate measurements of interstellar propagation effects and mitigating them effectively has become increasingly important to realise PTA goals. As these effects are much stronger at longer wavelengths, low-frequency observations are most appealing for characterizing the interstellar medium (ISM) along the sight lines toward PTA pulsars. The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and the Engineering Development Array (EDA), which utilizes MWA technologies, present promising opportunities for undertaking such studies, particularly for PTA pulsars located in the southern sky. Such pulsars are also the prime targets for PTA efforts planned with the South African MeerKAT, and eventually with the SKA. In this paper we report on observations of two bright southern millisecond pulsars PSRs J0437-4715 and J2145-0750 made with these facilities; MWA observations sampling multiple frequencies across the 80-250 MHz frequency range, while the EDA providing direct-sampled baseband data to yield a large instantaneous usable bandwidth of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}200 MHz. Using these observations, we investigate various aspects relating to pulsar emission and ISM properties, such as spectral evolution of the mean pulse shape, scintillation as a function of frequency, chromaticity in interstellar dispersion, and flux density spectra at low frequencies. Systematic and regular monitoring observations will help ascertain the role of low-frequency measurements in PTA experiments, while simultaneously providing a detailed characterization of the ISM toward the pulsars, which will be useful in devising optimal observing strategies for future PTA experiments.},

@article{Esamdin2005,
abstract = {ABSTRACT  We present high-quality observations of PSR B0826-34 at 1374 MHz. The emission from this pulsar exhibits strong bursts of pulses followed by long periods of 'null' pulses. When it is strong, the radiation extends throughout the whole pulse period. We show for the first time that there is weak emission during the 'null' phases, which should therefore be considered to be a different mode rather than being null. During this weak mode, the profile is similar to that observed in the strong mode at low radio frequency. Using a phase-tracking method, the pattern of drifting subpulses during the strong mode is seen to be coherent across the whole profile. The drift rate is variable and includes positive and negative values. 13 subpulse bands have been directly observed, covering the whole longitude range. The subpulses and their spacings (P2) are wider in one half of the profile than those in the other half. This difference, and the variation of observed P2 within the two regions, can be accounted for if the magnetic pole is inclined to the rotation axis by about 05. These two regions appear to represent radiation from outer and inner cones. The intensity modulation of subpulses in all longitude ranges is related to the magnitude of the drift rate.},

abstract = {A new set of software applications and libraries for use in the archival and analysis of pulsar astronomical data is introduced. Known collectively as the PSRCHIVE scheme, the code was developed in parallel with a new data storage format called PSRFITS, which is based on the Flexible Image Transport System (FITS). Both of these projects utilise a modular, object-oriented design philosophy. PSRCHIVE is an open source development environment that incorporates an extensive range of C++ object classes and pre-built command line and graphical utilities. These deal transparently and simultaneously with multiple data storage formats, thereby enhancing data portability and facilitating the adoption of the PSRFITS file format. Here, data are stored in a series of modular header-data units that provide flexibility and scope for future expansion. As it is based on FITS, various standard libraries and applications may be used for data input/output and visualisation. Both PSRCHIVE and PSRFITS are made publicly available to the academic community in the hope that this will promote their widespread use and acceptance.},

abstract = {We have embarked on a survey for pulsars and fast transients using the 13-beam multibeam receiver on the Parkes Radio Telescope. Installation of a digital backend allows us to record 400 MHz of bandwidth for each beam, split into 1024 channels and sampled every 64 $\mu$s. Limits of the receiver package restrict us to a 340 MHz observing band centred at 1352 MHz. The factor of 8 improvement in frequency resolution over previous multibeam surveys allows us to probe deeper into the Galactic plane for short-duration signals such as the pulses from millisecond pulsars. We plan to survey the entire southern sky in 42 641 pointings, split into low, mid and high Galactic latitude regions, with integration times of 4200, 540 and 270 s, respectively. Simulations suggest that we will discover 400 pulsars, of which 75 will be millisecond pulsars. With ∼30 per cent of the mid-latitude survey complete, we have redetected 223 previously known pulsars and discovered 27 pulsars, five of which are millisecond pulsars. The newly discovered millisecond pulsars tend to have larger dispersion measures than those discovered in previous surveys, as expected from the improved time and frequency resolution of our instrument.},

abstract = {An investigation of nulling and subpulse drifting in the two pulsars PSRs 0809+74 and 0818-13 is presented from data recorded at 408 MHz. Upper limits are placed, in the case of PSR 0809+74, on the time constants of the decay and rise of pulse energy at nulls of 0.065 and 0.26 s respectively. Significant drifting is found to occur during nulls in this pulsar. Its behavior is best described by a sudden change of drift rate at the start of the null, followed by an exponential relaxation to the normal drift rate, with emission restarting when a fixed fraction of the recovery has taken place. A similar phenomenon is observed for PSR 0818-13. For both pulsars the magnitude of these events appears to be proportional to the null strength. These observations are taken as evidence that the entity that is drifting survives in some form during nulls. An attempt is made to interpret this in terms of current models.},

abstract = {The phenomenon of subpulse drifting may hold the key to understanding the pulsar emission mechanism. Here, we report on new observations of PSR J0034‑0721 (B0031‑07) carried out with the Murchison Widefield Array at 185 {\{}MHz{\}}. We observe three distinct drift modes whose “vertical” drift band separations (P3) and relative abundances are consistent with previous studies at similar and higher frequencies. The drift bands, however, are observed to change their slopes over the course of individual drift modes, which can be interpreted as a continuously changing drift rate. The implied acceleration of the intrinsic carousel rotation cannot easily be explained by plasma models based on E×B drift. Furthermore, we find that methods of classifying the drift modes by means of P3 measurements can sometimes produce erroneous identifications in the presence of a changing drift rate. The “horizontal” separation between drift bands (P2) is found to be larger at later rotation phases within the pulse window, which is inconsistent with the established effects of retardation, aberration, and the motion of the visible point. Longer observations spanning at least ∼10,000 pulses are required to determine how the carousel rotation parameters change from one drift sequence to the next.},

@article{McSweeney2019a,
abstract = {The carousel model of pulsar emission attributes the phenomenon of subpulse drifting to a set of discrete sparks located very near the stellar surface rotating around the magnetic axis. Here, we investigate the subpulse drifting behavior of PSR B0031−07 in the context of the carousel model. We show that B0031−07's three drift modes (A, B, and C) can be understood in terms of a single carousel rotation rate if the number of sparks is allowed to change by an integral number, and where the different drift rates are due to (first-order) aliasing effects. This also results in harmonically related values for P 3 (the time it takes a subpulse to reappear at the same pulse phase), which we confirm for B0031−07. A representative solution has [n A, n B, n C] = [15, 14, 13] sparks and a carousel rotation period of P 4 = 16.4 P 1. We also investigate the frequency dependence of B0031−07's subpulse behavior. We extend the carousel model to include the dual effects of aberration and retardation, including the time it takes the information about the surface spark configuration to travel from the surface up to the emission point. Assuming these effects dominate at B0031−07's emission heights, we derive conservative emission height differences of ≲2000 km for mode A and ≲1000 km for modes B and C as seen between 185 and 610 MHz. This new method of measuring emission heights is independent of others that involve average profile components or the polarization position angle curve, and thus provides a potentially strong test of the carousel model.},

abstract = {The science cases for incorporating high time resolution capabilities into modern radio telescopes are as numerous as they are compelling. Science targets range from exotic sources such as pulsars, to our Sun, to recently detected possible extragalactic bursts of radio emission, the so-called fast radio bursts (FRBs). Originally conceived purely as an imaging telescope, the initial design of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) did not include the ability to access high time and frequency resolution voltage data. However, the flexibility of the MWA's software correlator allowed an off-the-shelf solution for adding this capability. This paper describes the system that records the 100 mus and 10 kHz resolution voltage data from the MWA. Example science applications, where this capability is critical, are presented, as well as accompanying commissioning results from this mode to demonstrate verification.},

We find that the subpulse drift is not aliased but directly  reflects the actual motion of the subbeams. The carousel-rotation time  must then be over 200 s, which is much longer than theoretically  predicted.},

abstract = {DSPSR is a high-performance, open-source, object-oriented, digital signal processing software library and application suite for use in radio pulsar astronomy. Written primarily in C++, the library implements an extensive range of modular algorithms that can optionally exploit both multiple-core processors and general-purpose graphics processing units. After over a decade of research and development, DSPSR is now stable and in widespread use in the community. This paper presents a detailed description of its functionality, justification of major design decisions, analysis of phase-coherent dispersion removal algorithms, and demonstration of performance on some contemporary microprocessor architectures.},

@article{Vivekanand1996,
abstract = {The drifting behavior of PSR B0031-07 is studied using 40,205 periods of high-quality data obtained with the Ooty Radio Telescope, operating at 327 MHz. We confirm the three drift modes centered at slope $\alpha$ = -4.05, -7.78, and -11.46 ms period-1, in the proportion 15.6%, 81.8%, and 2.6%, respectively. Strictly, the three drift modes are not harmonically related. The average subpulse energy and the rms position of the subpulse about the mean slope are both higher in the dominant drift mode, but the average subpulse width is independent of $\alpha$. The average subpulse profiles in the three drift modes are consistent with relativistic beaming. The average spacing P2 between two subpulses increases monotonically with | $\alpha$ | , contrary to the belief held so far that it is independent of | $\alpha$ | . The drift rate is enhanced at the edge of the integrated profile, which is apparently expected on the basis of the Ruderman & Sutherland model. The average pulse energy during a null is at least 844 times less than that during a burst. This is much higher than the factor of $\sim$100 that has been quoted so far. The integrated profiles in the three drift modes differ significantly from each other. These results (a) enhance the suspicion that the subpulse is the basic unit of radio emission in pulsars, (b) provide a possible model for mode changing in pulsars.},
