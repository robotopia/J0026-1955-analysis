1. What is the mean of the third column in Table 1? is it total length of each observation?Please clarify it and specify whether the unit of the value is second or minute?

The third column was the total number of pulsar rotations. But to make it clearer, we've now put in a column of length (in minutes), and changed the other columns to be the number of null and not-null pulses.

2. In the second paragraph of 3.1,the conclusion of nulling fraction of 78% is derived for all six observation or for only one observation?please clarity it in the paper.

The nulling fraction was derived from all six observations. Notice that it has now dropped down to 77% -- we were rounding it incorrectly in the previous version! Apart from adding a few words to clarify this in Section 3.1, we've also add a "Total" line to Table 1 that should make this also a bit clearer.

3. Could you calculate aproxamately the total numbers of nulls for the four observation(without the two observation on MJD 59002)?

About 72%. We've made a note of this also in the same paragraph in 3.1.

4. In Figure 1,please plot the baseline of each mean profile in oder to compare the mean profiles for the four observation better.

5. In Figure 3,the vertical coordinate are marked with "frequency".In my understanding,it should be "number" or other similar parameter,please cheak it.

"Frequency" is the word they normally use in statistics, which in that context means the same thing as "number" or "count". But it's true that it can be ambiguous in a radio astronomy context!
