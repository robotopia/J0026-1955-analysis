1. What is the mean of the third column in Table 1? is it total length of each observation?Please clarify it and specify whether the unit of the value is second or minute?

2. In the second paragraph of 3.1,the conclusion of nulling fraction of 78% is derived for all six observation or for only one observation?please clarity it in the paper.

3. Could you calculate aproxamately the total numbers of nulls for the four observation(without the two observation on MJD 59002)?

4. In Figure 1,please plot the baseline of each mean profile in oder to compare the mean profiles for the four observation better.

5. In Figure 3,the vertical coordinate are marked with "frequency".In my understanding,it should be "number" or other similar parameter,please cheak it.
